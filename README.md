# Deutsche Bank API Program

Open banking nowadays is not just a fashionable term, but has found its way into the everyday life of many financial service providers. 
With the API Program, Deutsche Bank makes a large amount of customer data accessible to third parties via public APIs. 
The technical cornerstone of this is the Developer Portal. With this repo, we would like to make it a little easier for interested developers 
to access our APIs, documentation and the sandbox.

Visit our Developer Portal at [developer.db.com](https://developer.db.com) to find out more.
